 * \section mainpage_introduction Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the documentation for a C++ library housed at [<b>this GitHub repository</b>](https://github.com/jointpoints/tms-nets)!
 * Corresponding library contains a generator of digital \f$(t, m, s)\f$-nets in base \f$2\f$ featuring the algorithm proposed
 * by Harald Niederreiter in 1987 in his article "Low-Discrepancy and Low-Dispersion Sequences". Broadly speaking, \f$(t, m, s)\f$-nets
 * are low-discrepancy discrete sets of points in \f$s\f$-dimensional unit cube. You may find more information about them in
 * the sources listed in [Recommended literature](@ref literature).
