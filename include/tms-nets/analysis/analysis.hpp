 * @brief Contains functions for digital nets analyses, like figures of merit and various statistics.
 * 
 * The precision of Quasi Monte Carlo calculations is directly related to the discrepancy of the
 * digital net (e.g., search for "Koksmaâ€“Hlawka inequality"). Discrepancy itself is computationally
 * hard to be calculated directly which makes researchers introduce different metrics conventionally
 * called <b>figures of merit</b> that help one estimate the true discrepancy.
 * 
 * Statistics features that are also introduced here might be useful to verify some basic
 * properties that any "good" digital net should obtain.
