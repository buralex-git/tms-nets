(t, m, s)-nets generator
========================

This repository contains a C++ generator of digital (t, m, s)-nets in base 2 as well as a number of tools to measure their figures of merit.

Available nets:

* Sobol,
* Niederreiter,
* Any digital net with manually set generating matrices.

Broadly speaking, (t, m, s)-nets are low-discrepancy finite sets of points in _s_-dimensional unit cube. They have been proven to be efficient in a number of Numerical Analysis tasks.
